# Contributions

We encourage contributions that are aligned with the goal of the library: we want to keep its scope manageable and focused on its original purpose.

If you want to collaborte either pick an existing issue or open a new one to suggest a new feature before submitting any pull request. If eventually an agreement is reached, the pull request has to fulfil all the CI checks and provide a sensible testing coverage of the new feature.
